# aBuildReferenceGuide
The python module aBuild is meant to automate the process of
building a mtp model for a paticular system. The documents presented
in this folder/book are meant to be a reference guide to bash, git, aBuild, etc.

In the main file, refGuide is a description of what to do to build
a model of a paticular system. refGuide.pdf will reference various
appendices to help the student develop the necessary skills to use
aBuild, i.e. bash, git, emacs, etc.

In addition to the refGuide and appendicies there will be several
cheat sheets for quick reference to various helpful commands.

Later on it will include a theory document, which will provide a basic
understanding of the theory the mtp model and DFT.

Includes the .tex files, will include the .pdf files when it is
further along in development.
