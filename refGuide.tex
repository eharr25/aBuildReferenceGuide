\section{Bash Commands}

First things first, you need to learn to navigate your command
line. Macs have a built in command line (terminal), but on Windows you will need
to download one first. The Ubuntu app works great. See Table
\ref{bashcommands} for a list of helpful commands.

\section{Emacs}

Emacs is a text editor that has a bunch of cool shortcuts you can
learn to make editing documents super easy. On a Mac you can download
Aquamacs, which uses the same commands as Emacs but you can click with
your mouse. \ref{emacs} Has a chart of basic Emacs
commands. \ref{aquamacs} has a list of Aquamacs specific things.

\section{Basics of Github}

This section is by no means comprehensive. In fact, there's probably a
lot of things missing. If you'd like to actually get good at Github,
you have a lot more work to do. But here's some basics.

The basic idea of Github is that several people can work on the same
code at the same time. It also has version control: if you don't like
the recent changes to your code, you can get rid of them by going back
to an old version of the code. You can have a copy of the code on your
machine to work on, and you can push your changes to the main copy of
the code. Most people, however, don't have their repositories open to
the public to edit. They will have to clear any suggested changes that
you push. But as they make edits, you can pull their copy down to your
machine. Github will warn you if there are any changes you have made
to the code that will be overwritten by copying their changes. It's a
powerful code sharing tool, but takes a little getting used to.

First you need to go make a Github account. Then you can fork (make a
copy of) whatever repository of code that you want to copy and
edit. If you don't want to make edits to the code yourself, you don't
have to make a fork, you can just copy directory from the original
repository each time.
To give your computer (or a remote computer) access to your repositories
on Github, add your computer's public SSH key to Github. How to do
this:
On your command line execute the following command to copy
your public ssh key:
\begin{verbatim}
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
\end{verbatim}
Note: If this didn't work, it means you don't have a public key and will
need to generate one. See the subsection below this for instructions
on how to do that. 

Now you will be able to paste this key into your account on Github. To
do this, go to Settings>SSH and GPG keys>New SSH key. Make sure you
name it something intuitive (e.g. My Mac, Marylou, etc.).

Now you can copy code from Github to your machine. It's
probably a good idea to make a directory to hold all the stuff you're
going to copy with a name you'll recognize later (e.g. \verb|aBuild/|
for aBuild, etc.). Usually these directories are in
\verb|~/codes/|. Now there are several scenarios involving the code
you're copying from Github. Here's a couple and what to do about them:

1. If you just want to make a copy of the code and don't
expect any changes to be made to it (like ever), use the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone git@github.com:user/repository.git
\end{verbatim}
You can do this over and over again, it will just overwrite the code
you copied to your machine. 

2.
a. If you expect to make your own changes to the code, start by making
a fork of the original code on Github. Then add a master copy of your
fork to your machine using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add master git@github.com:user/repository.git
\end{verbatim}
b. If you have your own code that you would like to edit and put on
Github for others to see, you will have to make your own repository on
Github, then use the same command as above.

3. If you want to be able to add someone else's updates to the code to
your machine, the convention is to call their repository
\verb|upstream|. You can add read only access to their repository to
your machine with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add upstream git@github.com:user/repository.git
\end{verbatim}

Now that you have a copy of the code, here's how to make changes to
the code on your machine, and on Github from your machine. Here's a
list of some basic Git commands \ref{git}. Remember that this is not a
comprehensive list.

    \endlastfoot
    \verb|git checkout file/to/update| & make a copy of upstream's
    version of the file on your machine \\ \hline
    \verb|git pull upstream master| & update your master copy
    with upstream's version \\ \hline
    \verb|git status| & tells you the status of each file on your
    machine with Github's copy \\ \hline
    \verb|git add file/to/add| & add your version of the file to the
    commit \\ \hline
    \verb|git commit| & commit the changes
    you added. Will open an editor for you to leave a comment\\ \hline
    \verb|git commit -m "comment"|& commit the changes
    you added and leave a comment \\ \hline
    \verb|git push| & pushes your latest commit to your fork on Git \\ \hline
    \verb|git push master upstream| & push your
    request to add your changes to upstream \\ \hline
  \end{longtable}
\end{center}

\section{Initialization Process}
To start working there are a series of steps and proceedure that must
be followed. The first step is to obtain an account to the supercomputer--likely
marylou. After setting up and account and logging on, you will need to
make several directories and download aBuild.  
\subsection{aBuild Download}
1. Become familiar with git --see git tutorial
\subsection{Make directories}
You will need to build the following directories:\\
\indent 1. .\verb|\|codes\verb|\|aBuild\\
\indent 2. \verb|\|bin\\
\indent 3. \verb|\|environments\\
\indent 2. \verb|\|Species-system (i.e. AuCu)

\subsubsection{bin directory}
\section{Training Process}                      
Once you have set up your system you are ready to start training the
model to your specific system. The python module aBuild is designed to
automate the train of the model process. This section will guild you
through the different commands needed to train the model.\\

The commands start with python ``builder.py **YAML**" and then the
various tags are used to step through the training process. The python
command is only used for the tags denoted by the `-'.
